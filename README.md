# Title: Parallelised Sharpe Ratio Calculator (OpenMP C Project)

A simple C program that uses OpenMP to speed up the calculation of rolling Sharpe ratios on sample stock return data. It reads returns from a CSV file, processes them in parallel, and prints out the average and annualised Sharpe ratio. Multiple methods for synchronisation were also considered (critical regions, atomic operations and mutexes).
